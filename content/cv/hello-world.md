## So Why Am I Doing This?

My Name is Dan Rousseau. I am a software developer living in South Africa. I have 3 years industry knowledge and a degree in Game Development. I have a passion for all types of programming, but have really found my niche in the web development space.

Ive decided to start this blog as a means to share knowledge with people that I personally struggled to find, and in some cases to understand. My aim is to share this information in a way that I think I would have better understood while learning.

My blog will focus on all things development, not limited to any specific niche, I will just write about topics that I find interesting, either from work or my personal projects. My hope is that anyone will be able to derive some value for my content, however a lot of it will be quite beginner - intermediate focused. I will be trying as often as possible to not only write code samples, but also share links to github repositories and more complete code examples. I would like to build a large archive of information for others as well as myself to look back on and hopefully it will be of use further down the line.
